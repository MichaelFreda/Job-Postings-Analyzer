# Job-Postings-Analyzer

For Dickinson College DATA200 Final Exam, I scraped and cleaned raw data from a website to conduct text analysis on to construct general insights on the job market and desired attributes.  I was able to create visualization for qualitative and quantitative data for 930 job postings with average hourly and salary wages, along with most mentioned responsibilities and skills.
